Description: >-
  AVL is a program for the aerodynamic and flight-dynamic analysis of rigid
  aircraft of arbitrary configuration. It employs an extended vortex lattice
  model for the lifting surfaces, together with a slender-body model for
  fuselages and nacelles. General nonlinear flight states can be specified. The
  flight dynamic analysis combines a full linearization of the aerodynamic model
  about any flight state, together with specified mass properties.
