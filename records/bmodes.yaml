Description: |-
  BModes is a finite-element code that provides dynamically coupled modes for a
  beam. The beam can be a rotor blade, rotating or non-rotating, or a tower.
  Both the blade and the tower can have a tip attachment. Examples of tip
  attachments are aerodynamic brakes for blades and rotor-nacelle assemblies
  for towers. In addition to the tip inertia, the tower can also have
  tension-wire supports.

  Wind turbine designers may use coupled modes for several applications such as
  modal-based modeling of blades and tower for validation of flexible-component
  models using experimental data, modal-based fatigue analysis, and
  interpretation of aeroelastic-stability behavior of turbines. BModes can be
  used to generate the blade and tower mode shapes used by the ElastoDyn module
  of FAST/OpenFAST.
