Description: >-
  MoorDyn is a simple, efficient, and versatile mooring system dynamics
  model designed to work in concert with other simulation tools. It is
  based on a lumped-mass discretization of a mooring line's dynamics, and
  adds point-mass and rigid-body objects to enable simulation of a wide
  variety of mooring and cabling arrangements. Hydrodynamics are included
  using a version of the Morison equation, and there is support for wave
  loads on surface-piercing cylinders.
