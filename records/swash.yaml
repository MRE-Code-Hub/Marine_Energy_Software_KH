Description: |-
  SWASH is a general-purpose numerical tool for simulating unsteady,
  non-hydrostatic, free-surface, rotational flow and transport phenomena in
  coastal waters as driven by waves, tides, buoyancy and wind forces. It
  provides a general basis for describing wave transformations from deep water
  to a beach, port or harbour, complex changes to rapidly varied flows, and
  density driven flows in coastal seas, estuaries, lakes and rivers.
