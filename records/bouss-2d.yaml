Description: |-
  BOUSS-2D is a comprehensive numerical model for simulating the propagation
  and transformation of waves in coastal regions and harbors based on a
  time-domain solution of Boussinesq-type equations. The governing equations
  are uniformly valid from deep to shallow water and can simulate most of the
  phenomena of interest in the nearshore zone and harbor basins including
  shoaling/refraction over variable topography, reflection/diffraction near
  structures, energy dissipation due to wave breaking and bottom friction,
  cross-spectral energy transfer due to nonlinear wave-wave interactions,
  breaking-induced longshore and rip currents, wave-current interaction and
  wave interaction with porous structures. Many processes at inlets and harbors
  can be studied using BOUSS-2D.
