Description: >-
  BOUSS-2D is a comprehensive numerical model for simulating the propagation
  and transformation of waves in coastal regions and harbors based on a
  time-domain solution of Boussinesq-type equations. The governing equations
  are uniformly valid from deep to shallow water and can simulate most
  of the phenomena of interest in the nearshore zone and harbor basins
  including shoaling/refraction over variable topography, reflection/diffraction
  near structures, energy dissipation due to wave breaking and bottom friction,
  cross-spectral energy transfer due to nonlinear wave-wave interactions,
  breaking-induced longshore and rip currents, wave-current interaction
  and wave interaction with porous structures. Many processes at inlets
  and harbors can be studied using BOUSS-2D.
