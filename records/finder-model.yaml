Description: |-
  The FINancial impacts of Distributed Energy Resources (FINDER) model
  quantifies changes in utility costs and revenues, as well as the financial
  impacts to utility shareholders and customers with the addition of demand-side
  and distributed energy resources (DERs) like energy efficiency, demand
  response, and distributed solar. The model can also assess incremental changes
  to utility regulatory and business models, like alternative rate designs,
  revenue decoupling, and utility financial incentives, and the efficacy of such
  approaches to mitigate negative financial impacts due to increased DER
  adoption.
