Description: |-
  MARKAL (MARKet and ALlocation) is a numerical model used to carry out
  economic analysis of different energy related systems at the country level to
  represent its evolution over a period of usually of 40-50 years. Various
  parameters such as energy costs, plant costs, plant performances, building
  performance and so on, can be input and the software will choose an optimal
  technology mix to meet that demand at minimum cost.
