Description: >-
  HydroDyn is a time-domain hydrodynamics module that has been coupled
  into the OpenFAST wind and marine turbine multi-physics engineering tool
  to enable aero-hydro-servo-elastic simulation of marine and offshore
  wind turbines. HydroDyn is applicable to both fixed-bottom and floating
  offshore substructures. HydroDyn can also be driven as a standalone code
  to compute hydrodynamic loading uncoupled from OpenFAST.
