Description: |-
  Ansys Aqwa software addresses the vast majority of analysis requirements
  associated with hydrodynamic assessment of all types of offshore and marine
  structures. These include SPARs, FPSOs, Semi-submersibles, Tension leg
  platforms, Ships, Renewable energy devices, and Breakwaters.

  Aqwa has been used extensively in the oil & gas, renewable and general
  engineering sectors to model installation and use of equipment in open water
  as well as in harbors or sheltered locations.

  Ansys Aqwa comprises two packages:

  Ansys Aqwa Diffraction is a boundary element method (BEM) solver that provides
  an integrated facility for developing primary hydrodynamic parameters required
  to undertake complex motions and response analysis. Model creation can be
  performed through Ansys DesignModeler software or via other Ansys structural
  mechanics tools using a provided Ansys APDL macro. Hydrodynamic analysis
  results, such as motions and pressures, can be transferred to Ansys structural
  mechanics products, Ansys ASAS or generically defined FE models for subsequent
  structural analysis.

  Ansys Aqwa Suite extends Ansys Aqwa Diffraction to include analysis
  capabilities for global performance of moored and/or connected systems subject
  to random sea states. Simulations may be static or dynamic in frequency and/or
  time domain. More advanced requirements, such as dynamic position systems and
  energy dissipation, can be accomplished through a user-defined function.
