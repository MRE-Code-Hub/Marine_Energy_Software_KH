Description: >-
  SubDyn is a time-domain structural-dynamics module for multimember wind
  and marine turbine substructures. The module has been coupled into the
  OpenFAST aero-hydro-servo-elastic engineering tool. SubDyn can also be
  driven as a standalone code to compute the mode shapes, natural frequencies,
  and time-domain responses of substructures under prescribed motion at
  the interface to the tower, uncoupled from OpenFAST and in the absence
  of external loading other than gravity. SubDyn relies on two main engineering
  schematizations: (1) a linear frame finite-element beam model (LFEB),
  and (2) a dynamics system reduction via the Craig-Bampton (C-B) method,
  together with a static-improvement method (SIM), greatly reducing the
  number of modes needed to obtain an accurate solution.
