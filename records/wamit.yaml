  WAMIT is a computer program based on the linear and second-order potential
  theory for analyzing floating or submerged bodies, in the presence of
  ocean waves. The boundary integral equation method (BIEM), also known
  as the boundary element method (BEM) or panel method , is used to solve
  for the velocity potential and fluid pressure on the submerged surfaces
  of the bodies. Separate solutions are carried out simultaneously for
  the diffraction problem, giving the effects of incident waves on the
  body, and the radiation problems for each of the prescribed modes of
  motion of the bodies. These solutions are then used to obtain the relevant
  hydrodynamic parameters including added-mass and damping coefficients,
  exciting forces, response-amplitude operators (RAO's), the pressure and
  fluid velocity, and the mean drift forces and moments. The second-order
  module, Version 6S, provides complete second-order nonlinear quantities
  in addition.
