  The Time-Sensitive Value Calculator is a publicly available, free, Excel-based
  tool by Berkeley Lab that estimates the value of energy efficiency and other
  distributed energy resource (DER) measures using hourly estimates of
  electricity system costs. The tool takes hourly profiles of up to six measures
  at a time and monetizes their value for six value streams, producing outputs
  in tabular and graphical formats.
