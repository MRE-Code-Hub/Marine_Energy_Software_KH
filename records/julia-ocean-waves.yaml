Description: >-
  JuliaOceanWaves is a collection of packages and functions for modeling
  wave energy converters.  The open-source software is designed to be used
  by the wave energy community to model new concepts, perform design optimization,
  and more.  Capabilities include: A representation of ocean wave spectra
  and input/output (e.g. read from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
  buoys) and post-processing functionalities;  A solver for the linear
  potential flow radiation and diffraction equations for wave forcing on
  floating structures.  Solving the floating body linear dynamics in the
  frequency domain.  Future additions to the software will include solving
  non-linear floating body dynamics in the time-domain through time-marching
  Ordinary Differential Equation solvers and the pseudo-spectral optimization
  method.
