Description: >-
  JuliaOceanWaves is a collection of packages and functions for modeling wave energy converters. 
  The open-source software is designed to be used by the wave energy community to model new concepts, perform design optimization, and more. 
  Capabilities include: A representation of ocean wave spectra and input/output (e.g. read from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration buoys) and post-processing functionalities; 
  A solver for the linear potential flow radiation and diffraction equations for wave forcing on floating structures. 
  Solving the floating body linear dynamics in the frequency domain. 
  Future additions to the software will include solving non-linear floating body dynamics in the time-domain through time-marching Ordinary Differential Equation solvers and the pseudo-spectral optimization method.
