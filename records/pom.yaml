  The Princeton Ocean Model (POM) is an ocean modeling code used to simulate a
  wide-range of problems, from small-scale coastal processes to global ocean
  climate change. POM is a sigma coordinate (terrain-following), free surface
  ocean model with embedded turbulence and wave sub-models, and wet-dry
  capability.
