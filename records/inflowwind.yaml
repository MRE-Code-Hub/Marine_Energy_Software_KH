Description: "InflowWind is a module for processing wind and current inflow.\
  \ It has been coupled to the OpenFAST wind and marine turbine multi-physics\
  \ engineering tool to enable aero-hydro-servo-elastic simulation of wind\
  \ and marine turbines. InflowWind can also be driven as a standalone\
  \ code to process wind and current inflow uncoupled from OpenFAST. "
