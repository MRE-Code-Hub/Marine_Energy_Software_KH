Description: |-
  This software implements a shape-matching based classifier algorithm for the
  underwater automated detection of marine life for that system. In addition to
  applying shape descriptors, the algorithm also adopts information theoretical
  learning based affine shape registration, improving point correspondences
  found by shape descriptors as well as the final similarity measure.
