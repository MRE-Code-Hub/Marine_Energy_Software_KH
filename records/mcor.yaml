Description: "The goal of the MCOR tool is to provide several viable microgrid\
  \ configurations that can meet  the resilience goals of a site and maximize\
  \ economic benefits. This means meeting a set of  critical loads for\
  \ a specified period of time, without any power supply from the electrical\
  \  grid. The tool simulates power dispatch for many different system\
  \ configurations, and ranks  the systems according to the goals of the\
  \ site. Currently, MCOR allows users to include PV,  tidal, battery,\
  \ and back-up diesel resources. "
