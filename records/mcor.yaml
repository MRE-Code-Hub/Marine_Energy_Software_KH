Description: >-
  The goal of the MCOR tool is to provide several viable microgrid configurations that can meet 
  the resilience goals of a site and maximize economic benefits. This means meeting a set of 
  critical loads for a specified period of time, without any power supply from the electrical 
  grid. The tool simulates power dispatch for many different system configurations, and ranks 
  the systems according to the goals of the site. Currently, MCOR allows users to include PV, 
  tidal, battery, and back-up diesel resources.
