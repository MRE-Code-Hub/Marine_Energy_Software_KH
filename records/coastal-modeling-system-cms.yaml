Description: |-
  The Coastal Modeling System is an integrated 2D numerical modeling system for
  simulating waves, current, water level, sediment transport, and morphology
  change at coastal inlets and entrances. Emphasis of the CMS is on navigation
  channel performance and sediment exchange between the inlet and adjacent
  beaches.
