Description: >-
  MODAQ 2.0 is the continuation of the Modular Ocean/Offshore Data AcQuisition
  system which offers new benefits of being based on generally available
  hardware and open-source development tools. The MODAQ 2.0 project is the
  amalgamation of ROS packages, tools, and guidance for developing data
  acquisition and control applications for marine energy devices using a ROS2
  based architecture. The MODAQ 2.0 Reference Design includes several packages
  that are targeted for the marine energy sector and allow most developers with
  a basic background in programming to spin up a high-quality DAQ and control
  system
