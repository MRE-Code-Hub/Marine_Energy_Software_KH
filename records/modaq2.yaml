  MODAQ 2.0 is the continuation of the Modular Ocean/Offshore Data AcQuisition
  system which offers new benefits of being based on generally available
  hardware and open-source development tools. The MODAQ 2.0 project is
  the amalgamation of ROS packages, tools, and guidance for developing
  data acquisition and control applications for marine energy devices using
  a ROS2 based architecture. The MODAQ 2.0 Reference Design includes several
  packages that are targeted for the marine energy sector and allow most
  developers with a basic background in programming to spin up a high-quality
  DAQ and control system
