Description: |-
  SWAN (Simulating Waves Nearshore) is a third-generation wave model, developed
  at Delft University of Technology, that computes random, short-crested wind-
  generated waves in coastal regions and inland waters. For more information
  about SWAN, see a short overview of model features. This list reflects on the
  scientific relevance of the development of SWAN.
