Description: |-
  ComFLOW is a simulation method for free-surface flow in terrestrial and
  micro-gravity environments. It models viscous two-phase flow (incompressible
  liquid, compressible gas) in and around arbitrary geometries. Effects of
  capillarity and liquid-solid body interaction are included.
