  Tidal Bladed has been developed for tidal turbine and component manufacturers,
  certification agencies, design consultants and research organisations across
  the world. Harnessing engineering models developed over the last 25 years,
  Tidal Bladed utilises common functionality with the industry leading wind
  turbine design tool Bladed, whilst introducing essential subsea science.
  Although Tidal Bladed is the first software of its kind, the heritage of
  Bladed provides users with a robust commercial design package with high
  quality modelling capabilities enabling technology developments to be
  accelerated with confidence.Tidal Bladed is already being utilised by tidal
  turbine device developers and it continues to improve and develop along with
  this growing sector.
