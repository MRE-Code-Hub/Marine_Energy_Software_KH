  OpenFAST is a multi-physics, multi-fidelity tool for simulating the coupled
  dynamic response of wind and marine turbines. Practically speaking, OpenFAST
  is the framework (or “glue code”) that couples computational modules
  for rotor aero/hydrodynamics, hydrodynamics for offshore structures,
  control and electrical system (servo) dynamics, and structural dynamics
  to enable coupled nonlinear aero-hydro-servo-elastic simulation in the
  time domain. OpenFAST enables the analysis of a range of wind and marine
  turbine configurations. Wind turbines can be modeled on land or offshore
  on fixed-bottom or floating substructures, and marine turbines can be
  modeled as fixed or floating.
