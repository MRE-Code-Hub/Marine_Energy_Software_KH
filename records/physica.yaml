Description: |-
  A software environment for the modelling of multi-physics phenomena. The
  numerical approach is based on finite volume methods but extended to
  unstructured meshes (ie. FV-UM). A range of interacting solution procedures
  for turbulent fluid flow, heat transfer with solidification/melting and
  elasto-visco-plastic solid mechanics are implemented.
