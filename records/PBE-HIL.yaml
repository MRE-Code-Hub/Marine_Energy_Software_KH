Description: >-
  PBE-HIL is a repository of Power Hardware-in-the-loop models developed
  for typical Powering the Blue Economy market loads and power requirements.
  The HIL models were developed to be as generic and functional as possible,  meaning
  that the user can easily configure these models to represent their unique
  PBE design. These PBE load and power requirement HIL models can then
  be used to inform marine energy converter (MEC) and power electronics
  design,  as well as be used in laboratory testing using HIL equipment,
  leading to improved understanding of MEC performance and lower risk prior
  to open-water MEC deployment.

  The current PBE HIL models that are available are: Ocean Observation
  Autonomous Underwater Vehicle charging Marine energy integration with
  microgrids (Future)
