Description: >-
AeroDyn is a time-domain wind and marine turbine aero/hydrodynamics module that is coupled in the OpenFAST multi-physics engineering tool to enable aero-elastic simulation of turbines. AeroDyn can also be driven as a standalone code to compute turbine aero/hydrodynamic response uncoupled from OpenFAST. AeroDyn contains blade element momentun and free vortex wake solvers.
