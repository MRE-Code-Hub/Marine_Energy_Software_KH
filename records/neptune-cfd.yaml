Description: |-
  NEPTUNE_CFD is based on a multi-fluid (Eulerian) approach. It can simulate a
  wide variety of multiphase flows: free-surface flows (adiabatic or not);
  dispersed flows (boiling flows, bubbly flows, particle-laden flows,
  droplet-laden flows) with closures to model the inter-phase transfers
  (momentum, mass, energy). Dedicated models are also available to simulate
  regime transitions of two-phase flows (from dispersed to stratified two-phase
  flows).
