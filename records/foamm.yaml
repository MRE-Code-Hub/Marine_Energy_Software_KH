  Finite Order Approximation by Moment-Matching is a Matlab application that
  implements a moment-matching based frequency-domain identification
  algorithm. This procedure was primarily developed for marine applications
  (specifically, wave energy). The identification of both the radiation kernel
  frequency response and the force-to-motion dynamics of a marine structure can
  be performed using this tool.
