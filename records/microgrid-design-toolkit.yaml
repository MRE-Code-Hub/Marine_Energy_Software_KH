Description: >-
  Sandia National Laboratories developed the Microgrid Design Toolkit (MDT),
  a decision support software for microgrid designers that is publicly
  available for download. Intended for use in the early stages of the design
  process, MDT uses powerful search algorithms to identify and characterize
  alternative microgrid designs in terms of user-defined inputs and objectives
  such as cost, performance, and reliability.
