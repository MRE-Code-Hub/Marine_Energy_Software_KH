Description: |-
  The Emissions & Generation Resource Integrated Database (eGRID) is a
  comprehensive source of data from EPA's Clean Air Markets Division on the
  environmental characteristics of almost all electric power generated in the
  United States.

  The data includes emissions, emission rates, generation, heat input, resource
  mix, and many other attributes. eGRID is typically used for greenhouse gas
  registries and inventories, carbon footprints, consumer information
  disclosure, emission inventories and standards, power market changes, and
  avoided emission estimates.
