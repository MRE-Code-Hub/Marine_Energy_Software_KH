  The Emissions & Generation Resource Integrated Database (eGRID) is a
  comprehensive source of data from EPA's Clean Air Markets Division on
  the environmental characteristics of almost all electric power generated
  in the United States.

  The data includes emissions, emission rates, generation, heat input,
  resource mix, and many other attributes. eGRID is typically used for
  greenhouse gas registries and inventories, carbon footprints, consumer
  information disclosure, emission inventories and standards, power market
  changes, and avoided emission estimates.
