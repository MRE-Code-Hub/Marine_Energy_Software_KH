Description: >-
  The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has developed a data
  acquisition system to support laboratory (component) and in-water validation
  and testing of Marine Renewable Energy (MRE) technologies. The Modular
  Ocean Data AcQuisition System (MODAQ) is a robust system built on industrial
  grade hardware that can acquire high-quality and summary data from many
  sensor and instrument types. MODAQ includes modules to perform real-time
  QC screening, system health monitoring, and send alerts. MODAQ is also
  part of a larger data management, processing, visualization, and archiving
  system.
