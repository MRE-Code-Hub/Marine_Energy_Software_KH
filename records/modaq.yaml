Description: >-
  The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has developed a data
  acquisition system to support laboratory (component) and in-water
  validation and testing of Marine Renewable Energy (MRE) technologies.
  The Modular Ocean Data AcQuisition System (MODAQ) is a robust system
  built on industrial grade hardware that can acquire high-quality and
  summary data from many sensor and instrument types. MODAQ includes
  modules to perform real-time QC screening, system health monitoring,
  and send alerts. MODAQ is also part of a larger data management,
  processing, visualization, and archiving system.
