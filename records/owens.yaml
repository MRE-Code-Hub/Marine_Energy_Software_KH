Description: >-
  The OWENS Toolkit (Onshore/Offshore Wind/Water ENergy Simulator) is an
  aero-hydro-servo-elastic  solver with integrated pre and post processing
  to enable a parametric end-to-end design tool. The originally intended
  use of the software focused on crossflow architectures,  which resulted
  in a generalized multibody modeling approach applicable to a variety
  of technologies. OWENS itself is an ontology for coupled analysis, and
  all of the sub-dependices can be run standalone. Many marine considerations
  neglected in wind applications have been added and development is ongoing
  in this area. Pure julia execution paths exist and both the native OWENS
  fluids and  structural modules are gradient safe, but the fluid-structure
  coupling interface has not yet been made gradient safe. Analysis options
  with OWENS include unsteady, steady,  and modal analysis, with helper
  functions to automate design load case (DLC) sweeps and  Campbell Diagrams
  including added mass effects. Optimization capabilities are available
  with coupling to WEIS.

  Floating aspects, turbulent inflow including wind-wave coupling, and
  higher  order vortex and panel methods are inherited from the OpenFAST
  libraries, which are  primarily Fortran. This also enables multi-turbine
  modeling for array affected fluid structure interaction. All other aspects
  from preprocessing to analysis to post processing are 100% Julia. Precompiled
  OpenFAST library binaries are included for the major operating systems
  to enable easy installation using the Julia package manager.
