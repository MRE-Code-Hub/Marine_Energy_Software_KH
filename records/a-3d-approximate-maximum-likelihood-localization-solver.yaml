Description: |-
  A robust three-dimensional solver was needed to accurately and efficiently
  estimate the time sequence of locations of fish tagged with acoustic
  transmitters and vocalizing marine mammals to describe in sufficient detail
  the information needed to assess the function of dam-passage design
  alternatives and support Marine Renewable Energy. An approximate maximum
  likelihood solver was developed using measurements of time difference of
  arrival from all hydrophones in receiving arrays on which a transmission was
  detected. Field experiments demonstrated that the developed solver performed
  significantly better in tracking efficiency and accuracy than other solvers
  described in the literature.
