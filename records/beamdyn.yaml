Description: >-
  BeamDyn is a time-domain structural-dynamics module for slender structures.
  The module couples into the OpenFAST aero-hydro-servo-elastic wind and
  marine turbine multi-physics engineering tool where it is used to model
  blade structural dynamics. BeamDyn provides capabilities for modeling
  initially curved and twisted composite wind and marine turbine blades
  undergoing large deformations. BeamDyn can also be driven as a stand-alone
  code to compute the static and dynamic responses of slender structures
  (blades or otherwise) under prescribed boundary and applied loading conditions
  uncoupled from OpenFAST. The model underlying BeamDyn is the geometrically
  exact beam theory (GEBT).
