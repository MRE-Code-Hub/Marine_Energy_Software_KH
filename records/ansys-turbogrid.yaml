Description: >-
  Ansys TurboGrid software includes novel technology that targets complete
  automation combined with an unprecedented level of mesh quality for even
  the most complex blade shapes. The desired final mesh size is defined
  (and, optionally, the blade boundary layer resolution), and all the other
  steps are performed automatically to produce a mesh of extremely high
  quality. Grid angles are exceptionally good, mesh sizes transition smoothly,
  and high aspect-ratio elements are generated in the near-wall regions
  to resolve these regions efficiently and capture boundary layer flows
  accurately.
