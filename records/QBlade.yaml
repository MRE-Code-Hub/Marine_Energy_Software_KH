Description: >-
  QBlade is a beyond the state of the art aero-servo-hydro-elastic code,
  covering the complete range of aspects required for wind turbine design,
  simulation, and certification. QBlade has been developed, tested, and
  validated during more than 10 years from the ground up, favoring a modular
  implementation of highly efficient novel aerodynamic, structural dynamic
  and hydrodynamic solvers in a modern, object-oriented C++ framework.
