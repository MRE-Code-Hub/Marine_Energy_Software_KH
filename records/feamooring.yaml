Description: >-
  The FEAMooring module in OpenFAST calculates the mooring line restoring
  force at the fairlead position of a floating platform considering the
  inertia and drag forces at each line element. In FEAMooring, the elastic
  rod model is used for modeling the mooring system. This model is ideal
  for small strain, large displacement structural analysis of slender members
  such as tether and catenary mooring lines. A single global coordinate
  system is used in the finite element formulation of the rod model. Therefore,
  the model is simpler and more efficient than other conventional nonlinear
  models, such as the updated Lagrangian beam model. In FEAMooring, the
  model was improved to include the stretch of the element under the axial
  tension.
