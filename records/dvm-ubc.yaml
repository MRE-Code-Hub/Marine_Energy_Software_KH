Description: >-
  A new formulation of the discrete vortex method (DVM-UBC) is proposed
  to describe the behavior of turbines and unsteady flow mathematically,
  and a numerical model is developed to predict the performance, the unsteady
  wake and acoustic emission of a stand-alone turbine using DVM-UBC.
