Description: |-
  A new formulation of the discrete vortex method (DVM-UBC) is proposed to
  describe the behavior of turbines and unsteady flow mathematically, and a
  numerical model is developed to predict the performance, the unsteady wake
  and acoustic emission of a stand-alone turbine using DVM-UBC.
