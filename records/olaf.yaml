Description: >-
  cOnvecting LAgrangian Filaments (OLAF) is a free vortex wake (FVW) module used to compute the aero/hydrodynamic forces on lifting bodies. This module has been incorporated into the physics-based engineering tool, OpenFAST, which solves the aero-hydro-servo-elastic dynamics of individual wind and marine turbines. OLAF is incorporated into the OpenFAST module, AeroDyn, as an alternative to the traditional blade-element momentum (BEM) option.
