# OPTIONAL: The description of the software package.
Description: >-
  The Spatial Environmental Assessment Tool (SEAT) evaluates potential environmental risk associated with marine energy device deployment by coupling
  modeled impacts with risk severity maps. As a graphical user interface-based software, it interacts with marine energy stressor and receptor data to
  evaluate the risk of changes to marine environment. SEAT, which relies on spatial and temporal data, is a plug-in for geospatial software QGIS.
