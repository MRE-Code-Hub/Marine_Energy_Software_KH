Description: >-
  The Spatial Environmental Assessment Tool (SEAT) evaluates potential
  environmental risk associated with marine energy device deployment by
  coupling modeled impacts with risk severity maps. As a graphical user
  interface-based software, it interacts with marine energy stressor and
  receptor data to evaluate the risk of changes to marine environment.
  SEAT, which relies on spatial and temporal data, is a plug-in for geospatial
  software QGIS.
